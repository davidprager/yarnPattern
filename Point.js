/*
 * File: Point.js
 * --------------
 * This file defines a simple class for representing encapsulated points.
 * In this implementation, the values of the variables x and y are stored
 * in the closure of the factory method and are therefore private to the
 * implementation.  The client can obtain these values using the getter
 * methods getX and getY but cannot change these values.
